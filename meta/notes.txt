Do we need to track utilization per instance?
Considering that we're running each component as a combination of instances, wouldn't tracking utilization per component suffice?
Replica components? In which case, tracking utilization per instance as well as overall utilization of that component might be useful.

TTL: As long as this field is non-zero for an instance (or a component?), the agent cannot delete it. 
This is to prevent 'thrashing', where an instance is added and removed continuously without significant utilization.
TTL = 0 doesn't mean it has to be removed, simply that it can be removed if the agent wants to.

Provisioning and Consolidation:
What - RL Agent Determines
When - RL Agent Determines (With TTL to prevent thrashing)
How - Defined in Component
Where - Determined by backpressure

Node: Intermediate Storage
Edge: Computational Component
